- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ana-LanitaChan
- 👀 I’m interested in quotes out of context.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UIUX & basics of html / css / javascript (because, what is uiux if you don't know how the things work?).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can contribute... do you need some graphics for your games? I'm illustrator! ( ´ ∀ `)ノ～ ♡ (my career started there, btw).
- 📫 How to reach me: send your owl to lanita.chan@gmail.com
